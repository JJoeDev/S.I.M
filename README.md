# DO NOT USE AS HELP

I somehow completly broke everythin in a desperate attempt to get it to work. Well, it should still work if you figure out how to either add a small delay from choosing the 'c' option and entering a name.

I think the issue might be that in the time of the user pressing enter on the 'c' option it also gets to register it for the name part, and there for gives it the name ' ' (ascii code 13 or 128).

I am taking a break from this project, and maybe even Zig. I may give Odin a try and we will see what I enjoy more. Who knows, maybe ill just stick to C++
